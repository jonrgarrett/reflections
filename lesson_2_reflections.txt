What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

      A .git file is created that is able to track commits for all files,
      directories, and subdirectories in the repository. This is how changes
      are tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

      The staging area is a holding area for files to enter before being
      committed to a repo. It offer the programmer a chance to review the
      files they are working with and what their status is.
