When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you are collobrating with people in different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?

    Because you might want to review changes before you bring them to your local drive.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork - copying a repository on Github to personal Github account (stays remote)
    Clone - copying a repository on your local machine or from Github to your local machine
    Branch - leaving the master fork to experiment or tinker with things that you do not want associated with main code

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    Because you can work on it offline if you need to.
