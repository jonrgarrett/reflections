When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you are collobrating with people in different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?

    Because you might want to review changes before you bring them to your local drive.
